## Do you wanna know how to use Ray?
You can start with the [documentation](https://rayframework.github.io/site/documentation/), the [getting started guide](https://rayframework.github.io/site/getting_started/) or checking a [example of a simple Evernote-like application](https://github.com/felipevolpone/ray/blob/master/examples/simple_note/app.py).

## Why use Ray?

The Ray framework it's a kind of mix of Django and Flask. Django it's the kind of framework that you're stuck with it (this is not always a problem), once you start using it, will become hard to get out of it. In the other side, Flask is a micro-framework that you can connect with a lot of plugins from the python community. Ray tries to get the best of both sides, having a small, but powerful core, and allowing plugins to connect with it.

With Ray you can develop powerful REST APIs in a simple way and have the core of your application not coupled with the framework.
